# Topical_Chatbot
A topical chatbot is a specialized AI designed for conversations about a specific subject. Unlike general chatbots, these focus on one topic, like medicine or finance. They're trained to understand and discuss that area, using datasets of relevant conversations. Topical chatbots provide accurate and helpful information within their domain, enhancing user engagement and knowledge in that subject. However, they may struggle with topics beyond their training and lack broader conversational abilities.

Dataset: 
The dataset used for this project is Topical Chat dataset from Amazon. It consists of over 8000 conversations and over 184000 messages. Within each message, there is: A conversation id, which is basically which conversation the message takes place in. Each message is either the start of a conversation or a reply from the previous message. There is also a sentiment, which represents the emotion that the person who sent the message is feeling. There are 8 sentiments: Angry, Curious to Dive Deeper, Disguised, Fearful, Happy, Sad, and Surprised.
